## Introduction

In this repository, you'll find a collection of implementations for various data structures and algorithms, written in different programming languages. The purpose of this repository is to serve as a learning resource and a playground for practicing DSA concepts.

## Data Structures

The following data structures are covered in this repository:

- [Arrays](data-structures/arrays)
- [Linked Lists](data-structures/linked-lists)
- [Stacks](data-structures/stacks)
- [Queues](data-structures/queues)
- [Trees](data-structures/trees)
- [Graphs](data-structures/graphs)
- [Hash Tables](data-structures/hash-tables)
- [Heaps](data-structures/heaps)

Each data structure directory contains implementations, examples, and related problems.

## Algorithms

The following algorithms are implemented in this repository:

- [Sorting Algorithms](algorithms/sorting)
- [Searching Algorithms](algorithms/searching)
- [Graph Algorithms](algorithms/graphs)
- [Dynamic Programming](algorithms/dynamic-programming)
- [Greedy Algorithms](algorithms/greedy)
- [Divide and Conquer](algorithms/divide-and-conquer)

Each algorithm directory contains implementations, explanations, and related problems.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/sampat646/DSA.git`
2. Navigate to the desired data structure or algorithm directory.
3. Explore the code, examples, and problem statements.
4. Implement your own solutions or modify the existing ones.
5. Test your implementations and compare them with the provided solutions.
