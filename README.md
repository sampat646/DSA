## Introduction

In this repository, you'll find a collection of implementations for various patterns and digit problems, written in different programming languages. The purpose of this repository is to serve as a learning resource and a playground for practicing DSA concepts. I will be adding more topics like data structures and algorithms in the future.

## Patterns

The following coding patterns are covered in this repository:

- [Invert Pyramid](patterns/Invert-pyramid.cpp)
- [Invert Triangle](patterns/Invert-triangle.cpp)
- [Normal Pattern](patterns/Normalpattern.cpp)
- [Number Printing Triangle Shape](patterns/Numberprintingtriangleshape.cpp)
- [Number Printing Triangle Shape 2](patterns/Numberprintingtringleshape2.cpp)
- [Pyramid](patterns/Pyramid.cpp)
- [Triangle Shape](patterns/Triangle-shape.cpp)

Each pattern directory contains implementations, examples, and related problems.

## Digit Problems

The following digit problems are covered in this repository:

- [Add Digit](digit-problems/Add-digit.cpp)
- [Armstrong Number](digit-problems/Armstrong-number.cpp)
- [Counting Numbers](digit-problems/CountingNumbers.cpp)
- [Divisors of a Number](digit-problems/DivisorsofaNumber.cpp)
- [GCD](digit-problems/GCD.cpp)
- [Prime Number](digit-problems/Prime-number.cpp)
- [Reverse Number](digit-problems/ReverseNumber.cpp)
- [Number Palindrome](digit-problems/numberPlandrome.cpp)

Each digit problem directory contains problem statements, solutions, and explanations.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/sampat646/DSA.git`
2. Navigate to the desired pattern or digit problem directory.
3. Explore the code, examples, and problem statements.
4. Implement your own solutions or modify the existing ones.
5. Test your implementations and compare them with the provided solutions.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you find any issues or have improvements to suggest, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Feel free to add new patterns, digit problems, or problem solutions.
